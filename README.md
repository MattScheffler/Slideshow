# Slideshow
Application for viewing a slideshow

C#, Windows Forms, .Net 4.5

Has options for viewing a normal slideshow, or randomizing the images.

Current issues:

* The order of the images gets mixed up when running a slideshow from the same path twice.
* When maximized, the image is still in a window and not covering the full area of the monitor.
* The UI is a bit plain, may be improved in the future.
